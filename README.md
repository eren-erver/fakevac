# Fake VAC Ban
It disconnects you as soon as you enter a server and displays a "vac banned from secure server" message on screen.
Could be used as a prank.
You need to add -netcon <port> (default is 25) on csgo launch options.
This won't cause a real VAC ban but I am not responsible for any bans or such , using this is your decision.
